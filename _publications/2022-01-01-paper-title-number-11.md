The synthesis, photophysics, and electrochemiluminescence (ECL) of four water-soluble dinuclear Ir(iii) and Ru(ii) complexes (1–4) terminally-capped by 4′-phenyl-2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine (tpy) or 1,3-di(pyrid-2-yl)-4,6-dimethylbenzene (N^C^N) ligands and linked by a 2,7-bis(2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridyl)fluorene with oligoether chains on C9 are reported. The impact of the tpy or NCN ligands and metal centers on the photophysical properties of 1–4 was assessed by spectroscopic methods including UV-vis absorption, emission, and transient absorption, and by time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations. These complexes exhibited distinct singlet and triplet excited-state properties upon variation of the terminal-capping terdentate ligands and the metal centers. The ECL properties of complexes 1–3 with better water solubility were investigated in neutral phosphate buffer solutions (PBS) by adding tripropylamine (TPA) as a co-reactant, and the observed ECL intensity followed the descending order of 3 > 1 > 2. Complex 3 bearing the [Ru(tpy)2]2+ units displayed more pronounced ECL signals, giving its analogues great potential for further ECL study.
